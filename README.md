# Fraud Detection Using Supervised and Anomaly-Based Models

This project aims to detect fraudulent financial transactions using both supervised machine learning models and unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. We used the **PaySim synthetic dataset**, which simulates mobile money transactions, and applied models like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Isolation Forest** to identify suspicious activity.

The project explores class imbalance, feature importance, model evaluation metrics (recall, precision, F1 score, ROC AUC), and compares performance between traditional classifiers and anomaly-based approaches. The end goal is to build a reliable system that can detect fraud accurately while minimizing false positives.
